## Discovering My Path in Software Engineering

My primary interest in software engineering lies in building efficient and reliable systems that solve real-world problems. I am especially motivated by projects that challenge me to think cirtically about data structures and program design, making applications both functional and scalable. Over time, I have gained experience with multiple programming languages and problem-solving methodologies, which has shaped how I see my role in the field. 

## Lessons from Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming

One of the most valuable lessons I've learned came from developing a bank database application in both C and C++. Working first with procedural design and then transitioning to object-oriented programming taught me how the choice of paradigm impacts maintainability and flexibility. Linked lists, file I/O, and debugging gave me hands-on practice with low-level details, while encapsulation and modular design in C++ helped me appreciate cleaner architecture

## The power of integration

I am also fascinated by the idea of briding technologies. For instance, through the Java Native Interface (JNI), I created a program that linked Java's user-facing components with C's mathematical logic. That experience underscored the importance of interoperability, showing how combining the strenghts of different languages can result in more powerful systems.

## Looking Ahead

Going forward, I want to deepen my expertise in algorithms, data structures, and scalable software design. At the same time, I'm eager to expand into web development, databases, and cloud technologies to gain practical, industry-relevant skills. My ultimate goal is to work on software that not only functions well but also has a positive impact on users and communities.
