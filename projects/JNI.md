summary: "Program from ICS 212 that used two languages for front end and back end"
---

Created a cross-language application that generates a formatted table of numbers and checks whether each value is a multiple of three. The Java front-end handled user input and table display, while the C back-end handled the mathematical logic, connected through the Java Native Interface (JNI). This allowed me to develop skills in software interoperability and modular design by integrating two programming languages. Showcased the ability to bridge systems-level logic with higher-level interfaces.
