summary: "Developed a banking database system that allows users to add, delete, search, and display customer records. Originally implemented in C using linked lists and later refactored into an object-oriented design in C++. Included features such as file I/O for persistence, robust input validation, and a debug mode for tracing program execution.With this project I gained experience with both procedural and object-oriented programming, memory management, and debugging practices. This allowed me to demonstrated the ability to design and implement data structures and manage persistent storage."
